# Prerequisites

In this lesson we take a look at the basic concepts associate with the topic.

# XML

- Extensible Markup Language (XML)

## What is a Markup Language?

- Includes markups i.e. syntactic annotations as an integral part of the text
- Examples are XML, LaTeX, HTML etc

XML is a meta markup language i.e. it has no predefined syntactic presentations that a document must abide by (unlike HTML). Authors can define and create new "tag"s trivially.

## XML Tree View

The most important concept when manipulating XML is that of nodes and trees.

- An XML document is represented by a "tree"
- The individual elements in the tree are the "node"s
- Programs can navigate around the tree and access the nodes using a specific address scheme called XPATH

# XPATH

XPath is a language for addressing parts of an XML document, designed to be used by XSLT, XPointer, XQuery etc.

The W3C Recommendation can be found [here](http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/).
